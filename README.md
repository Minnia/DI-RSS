# What is this? 🧐 

This is the result of my code test from DI! 👩‍💻 

## Cool, what was the task?

Basically to use an endpoint to

- Retrieve the latest content from one of the feeds
- Display a list of the 10 most recently published articles/contents,
  sorted by publish date (I've chosen asc to desc)
- Present the result in a suitable way

## How have you interpreted 'suitable'? 🎩 

Good question. I thought about doing my own design, but
quickly realized that it'd be overengineered, with too much
focus put on designing rather than coding.

That's why I chose to stick with the colors and design of
the [http://di.se](http://di.se) website, with colors and shapes being the same. 👩‍🎨 

## How can I see it? 👀 

1. Make sure you install all the dependencies and packages
   by running `npm i` or `npm install` in the root of the project

2. Run `npm start` in the project. This should take you to your
   browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

3. See the 10 most recently published articles/contents
